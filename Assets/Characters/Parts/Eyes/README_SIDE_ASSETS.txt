Side-view face assets (Option B)
==============================

Drop your side-view sprites in this folder.

Naming (same pattern as Body/Top: direction in the name):
  • Front (already present):  eyes_round_01.png
  • Side (east/west):         eyes_side_round_01.png

The same side sprite is used for both east and west; west is drawn with flipX.
Until you add eyes_side_round_01.png, the front sprite is used for side view.

After adding any new side assets: run Unity menu "Tools > Character > Populate Sprite Library"
so in-game characters use the new sprites.
